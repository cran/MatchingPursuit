R package for processing time series data using the **Matching Pursuit** (**MP**) algorithm, 
a greedy signal decomposition technique that represents complex signals as a linear combination 
of simpler functions (called atoms) selected from a redundant dictionary. Support for the 
**Orthogonal Matching Pursuit** (**OMP**) variant of the classical MP algorithm is also provided.

In addition to generic time-series data, the package supports direct loading of
data stored in **EDF/EDF(+)** and **WFDB** (WaveForm DataBase) formats.
These formats are widely used for physiological signals such as EEG and ECG recordings.
Support for EDF/EDF(+) and WFDB import facilitates the analysis of biomedical signals.

## Installation
